# Keyword-Search-Project - Virtual data room project

We have thousands of files of different file formats (txt, xlsx, csv, png, pdf, docx, pptx, gif etc) in a root directory.
We have a data dictioanry of key words. 

The scripts process each and every file and capture the words that are present in the data dictionary.
